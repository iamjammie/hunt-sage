Threat hunting is a **proactive** search for adversaries that have bypassed or disabled automated defenses.

It is:

- Hypothesis-driven
- Data-informed
- Iterative
- Documented

> Alerts answer *what* happened. Hunts ask *what could be happening that we don't see yet?*

In this article, we cover:

1. Why traditional SOC monitoring is not enough  
2. Building a hunt hypothesis using MITRE ATT&CK  
3. Logging pre-requisites and visibility gaps  
4. Documenting hunts as reusable playbooks
