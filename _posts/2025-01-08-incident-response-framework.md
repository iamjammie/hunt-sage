A resilient **incident response (IR)** capability is more than just a PDF runbook.

Core pillars:

1. **Preparation** – asset inventory, baselines, log coverage  
2. **Detection & Analysis** – triage, enrichment, correlation  
3. **Containment, Eradication, Recovery** – impact-appropriate actions  
4. **Post-Incident** – lessons learned, control updates, hunt tasks

Well-run IR feeds **threat hunting** and **detection engineering** with fresh, validated patterns of attacker behavior.
